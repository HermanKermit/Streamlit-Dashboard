    Cross-analysis of the data highlights a simple reality: **salary alone is not enough to measure standard of living**.

What matters is the **ratio between income and local prices**.

We have seen this for food, education, gasoline, and the price difference for a product such as beer between imports and exports.


Even a trivial product can reveal profound political and economic choices, between trade openness and protectionism.


The cost of living is not a raw figure but a relative experience :
- relative to salary,
- relative to public policies,
- relative to social and cultural priorities.

This dashboard shows that the standard of living is revealed by a large number of factors, but also that this purchasing power hides
how residents access (or not) the essentials, and at what price.
